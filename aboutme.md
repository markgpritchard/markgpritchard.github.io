# Career history 

## DPhil student, University of Oxford 

## Specialty Registrar in Public Health, Oxford School of Public Health 

## Junior doctor posts in hospital medicine

## Academic Foundation Programme Doctor, Royal Stoke University Hospital  

Most of my foundation programme was the same as a non-academic programme. I completed placements in general surgery, acute medicine, general paediatrics, general practice and diabetes and endocrinology, and I obtained the foundation programme competencies. My main academic placement was in primary care at [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/medicine/research/primarycareresearchthemes/). I used survey data from 11 thousand people to investigate the relationship between joint pain and anxiety symptoms, and the management of each. Other academic work included following outcomes of children with a long-term cough who had been investigated and treated with antibiotics. 

Key publications were
