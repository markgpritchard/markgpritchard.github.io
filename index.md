I am a doctor undertaking specialty training in public health medicine at Oxford School of Public Health. I am currently taking time out of my public health training to complete a DPhil (PhD) modelling infectious disease dynamics at the University of Oxford. I am interested in finding ways to estimate the effectiveness of infection-prevention measures that have never been tested in clinical trials.
