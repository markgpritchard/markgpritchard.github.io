I am a public health registrar in the Thames Valley and a DPhil (PhD) student modelling infectious disease dynamics at the University of Oxford. 

I joined the [Thames Valley public health programme](https://www.oxsph.org/) in 2017. When the covid-19 pandemic started in 2020 I split my time between working with the local Public Health England health protection team and helping the research effort via the [International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium](https://isaric.org/). The early months of the pandemic made clear the importance of reaching valid conclusions from imperfect observational data. After a brief return to local authority public health during which I worked on local implementation of rapid testing for covid-19, I started my PhD in the summer of 2021.

These pages are intended to give some brief details about my work. You can also find me using any of the social links at the bottom.
