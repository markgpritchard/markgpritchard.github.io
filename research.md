## International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC)

I joined [ISARIC](https://isaric.org/) in February 2020 when covid-19 started to spread globally. Through international collaboration in data collection, analysis and dissemination, they assembed a tremendous observational dataset about people admitted to hospital with covid-19. I wrote analyses and code for the regular [clinical data report](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155218v1.article-info) and led an analysis of variation in symptoms of people of different ages [[&rarr; publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-021-01599-5)].
