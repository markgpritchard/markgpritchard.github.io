Covid-19 vaccinations are very effective in preventing severe disease and deat but their effectiveness declines over time. `Booster' vaccinations have been given to front line health and social care workers to increase their protection. I am interested in whether changes in the prevalence of the virus could make the vaccine more or less effective at different times. A simple mathematical model suggests a turning point at which a relatively low prevalence of infection could pose a greater risk of infection than a higher one. This work is still in its early stages, but I am investigating whether this may really be the case for healthcare workers, and if so, what the implications of this would be for optimizing booster vaccination programmes.

## International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC)

I joined [ISARIC](https://isaric.org/) in February 2020 when covid-19 started to spread globally. Through international collaboration in data collection, analysis and dissemination, they assembed a tremendous observational dataset about people admitted to hospital with covid-19. I wrote analyses and code for the regular [clinical data report](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155218v1.article-info) and led an analysis of variation in symptoms of people of different ages [[&rarr; publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-021-01599-5)].
