I am a public health registrar in the Thames Valley, and a PhD student modelling infectious disease dynamics at the University of Oxford. 

After completing my foundation doctor years in Stoke-on-Trent, I took some time out of training. I worked in intensive care medicine and infectious diseases, and joined a conservation research project in Madagascar as an expedition medic. I joined the [Thames Valley public health programme](https://www.oxsph.org/) in 2017. I was deeply interested in using academic research to improve the evidence base for public health action, but was unsure what route would best suit my interests. When the covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, I split my time between working with the local Public Health England health protection team, and helping the research effort via the [International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium](https://isaric.org/), out of the University of Oxford. The early months of the pandemic made clear the importance of reaching sound evidence-based approaches in the absence of extensive experimental data. I decided to apply for a PhD studying infectious disease dynamics. After a brief return to local authority public health, during which I worked on local implementation of rapid testing for covid-19, I started my PhD in the summer of 2021.
