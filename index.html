=======

I am a public health specialty registrar with the [Oxford School of Public Health](https://www.oxsph.org/) and a DPhil 
(PhD) student with the [University of Oxford](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/). My research aims to understand 
how infectious diseases spread in healthcare settings, and how we might intervene to slow or prevent this.  I am 
currently developing a mathematical model investigating how re-exposure to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that causes covid-19, 
or repeat vaccination, affects immune response.
