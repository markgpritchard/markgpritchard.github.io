I am a public health doctor at the [Oxford School of Public Health](https://www.oxsph.org/) and am working toward a PhD in clinical medicine at the [University of Oxford](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/). I am 
investigating how immunity to respiratory viruses changes after exposure to the virus or vaccination against it, and the 
best ways for vaccination policies to stop spread of infection within healthcare settings and the wider community.
