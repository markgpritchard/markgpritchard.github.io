I enjoy wildlife photography when I get the chance. Here I share a few photographs that I am particularly pleased with.

I took this picture from the _Akademik Sergey Vavilov_ near Sju√∏yane. It was close to midnight in early July. We were far inside the Arctic Circle so the sun never set during this trip. We got to watch this bear for several hours. This picture, where the bear is looking at its reflection, was my favourite.

I took this picture at Ornithological Park of Pont de Gau. It is a remarkable place for water birds with the greater flamingo an especially colourful attraction. I captured this picture shortly after it took off, using an exposure of 1/30 s to achieve the blurred background.
