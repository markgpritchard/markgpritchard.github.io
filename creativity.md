# Photography

I enjoy photography, and especially wildlife photography, when I get the chance. Here I share a few photographs I am pleased with.

These pictures of polar bears were taken from the _Akademik Sergey Vavilov_, north of the Arctic Circle near Norway.

I took this picture at Ornithological Park of Pont de Gau. It is a remarkable place for water birds with the greater flamingo an especially colourful attraction. I captured this picture shortly after it took off, using an exposure of 1/30&nbsp;s to achieve the blurred background.

# Painting

I bought myself paints during the covid-19 social distancing measures of 2020. My favourite painting so far is this one of Broken Arch in Arches National Park, Utah.
