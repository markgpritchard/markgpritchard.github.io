# Photography

I enjoy photography, and especially wildlife photography, when I get the chance. Here I share a few photographs I am pleased with.

I took this picture from the _Akademik Sergey Vavilov_ near Sju√∏yane. It was close to midnight in early July. We were far inside the Arctic Circle so the sun never set during this trip. We got to watch this bear for several hours. This picture, where the bear is looking at its reflection, was my favourite.

I took this picture at Ornithological Park of Pont de Gau. It is a remarkable place for water birds with the greater flamingo an especially colourful attraction. I captured this picture shortly after it took off, using an exposure of 1/30&nbsp;s to achieve the blurred background.

Remains of the Pont du Gard Roman aqueduct in southern France.

# Painting

I bought myself paints during the covid-19 social distancing measures of 2020. My favourite painting so far is this one of Broken Arch in Arches National Park, Utah.
